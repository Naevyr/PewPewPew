#PewPewPew

Entry for the GBJAM 11 (2023)
You can play PewPewPew on [Itch.io](https://naevyr.itch.io/pewpewpew).

All the code and assets are entirely made by myself. [Naevyr](https://github.com/Naevyr)


Built with [Godot](https://godotengine.org).



As it was made in 10 days and not properly balanced during and after, considering initial feedback, it's not advised for the faint of heart.


If you have any issues or want to give feedback, please [open an issue](https://github.com/Naevyr/PewPewPew/issues)
